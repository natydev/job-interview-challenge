# Level 1

Calculate how many days are available in the period. We are in Italy.

Write code that generates `output.json` from `data.json`.

From terminal run: 
```
ruby main.rb
```
 to generate file `level1-output.json`


# Level 2

Calculate how many days are available in the period for every developer.
Every developer wants a free day on his birthday and we must manage a local holiday "Santo Patrono di Padova".

Write code that generates `output.json` from `data.json`.


# Level 3

We have some projects with a defined effort in a period.
Tractus must understand the project feasibility based on developers availability.

Simplification: project feasibility is independent by other project running in same period, It is based only on period and developers workdays.

Write code that generates `output.json` from `data.json`.
